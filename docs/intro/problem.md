# The Problem

**TAPPaaS** addresses two interconnected problems in modern computing.

---

## Problem One: Internet Centralization

The internet was designed as a connection of local nets - a distributed architecture without central points of failure. However, hyperscalers have shifted toward a centralized "hub and spoke" model where users surrender autonomy.

Think of it like a town with only one mall versus a distributed city where people have choices about commerce, dining, and transportation. The centralized approach resembles "one mall in town" where options are limited and freedom is constrained.

This contrasts sharply with the original vision of a distributed ecosystem where users maintain control over their digital lives.

## Problem Two: IT Complexity

Modern IT infrastructure demands expertise many organizations simply don't have:

- **Firewalls** - Network security and access control
- **Identity management** - User authentication and authorization
- **Infrastructure services** - Servers, storage, networking
- **Security monitoring** - Threat detection and response
- **Constant patching** - Keeping systems updated and secure

For most smaller organizations, let alone individual families and communities, this complexity is almost insurmountable. Deploying secure, reliable platforms requires specialized expertise that few can afford.

## The Solution

TAPPaaS proposes addressing these gaps through three key principles:

### Curation

Making decisive selections from the numerous open-source software options available. Instead of overwhelming users with choices, TAPPaaS curates quality solutions that work together.

### Integration

Configuring tools to work cohesively as a unified platform. Each component is selected and configured to complement the others, creating a seamless experience.

### Automation

Streamlining installation to reduce implementation from weeks of manual work to manageable timeframes. What once required specialized expertise becomes accessible to anyone.
