# Our Approach

TAPPaaS is an open-source initiative that assembles existing FOSS components into an integrated platform rather than building from scratch. Most of the vision can be realized using existing open source software - our job is to curate, integrate, and automate.

## Core Design Principles

The project adheres to several key guidelines:

### 1. Free and Open Source Software

All components must be Free and Open Source Software. No proprietary dependencies, no vendor lock-in.

### 2. Deliberately Limited Options

We limit options to reduce barriers for new users. Rather than offering every possible choice, we make opinionated decisions that work well together.

### 3. Mature, Actively Maintained Software

We prioritize software that has proven itself in production environments and has an active community maintaining it.

### 4. Seamless Integration and Automation

Every module must integrate seamlessly with the others. Automation is built-in from the start, not bolted on afterward.

### 5. Distinct User Experiences

We create distinct experiences for different roles:

- **Developers** - Building and extending the platform
- **Installers** - Deploying TAPPaaS for users
- **Maintainers** - Keeping systems running day-to-day
- **End Users** - Using the services without worrying about infrastructure

### 6. Mobile Accessibility

The platform must be accessible from mobile devices. Modern users expect to manage their digital lives from anywhere.

### 7. Offline Functionality

Systems must work even when internet connectivity is limited or unavailable. Local resilience is a core requirement.

## Assembly Over Creation

Rather than reinventing the wheel, TAPPaaS focuses on:

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Curation** | Selecting the best open source tools for each function |
| **Integration** | Configuring components to work together seamlessly |
| **Automation** | Scripting installation and maintenance tasks |
| **Documentation** | Making the platform accessible to non-experts |

This approach lets us move faster and build on the collective work of the open source community.
