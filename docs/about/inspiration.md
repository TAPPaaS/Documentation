# Inspiration

TAPPaaS builds on the work and ideas of many open source projects and creators. Here we acknowledge the projects that have inspired us and explain how TAPPaaS relates to them.

## Related Projects

### Proxmox Helper Scripts

We have taken inspiration and code from this project, thank you!

The helper scripts project creates a consolidated list of all possible Proxmox configuration scripts. TAPPaaS takes a different approach - we consolidate into a single coherent and integrated system, using a subset of scripts with overall orchestration and inter-module integrations. Additionally, helper scripts typically ask many questions upfront, while TAPPaaS aims to predetermine these choices.

### Garage by Deuxfleur

This is perfect for TAPPaaS: "Data resiliency for everyone." We plan to include Garage in TAPPaaS, though the built-in Ceph file system in Proxmox competes in the S3 space. The core principles and philosophy of Deuxfleurs are very aligned with TAPPaaS.

### CasaOS

"Your Personal Cloud OS" - CasaOS focuses on personal use of cloud services. Its point-and-click installation of many open source products into a single environment is inspirational.

TAPPaaS differs in that it's designed for communities and businesses, not just personal use. We focus on creating a resilient IT backbone rather than connecting cloud services. TAPPaaS aims to remove reliance on services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud.

### Frappe

[frappe.io/framework](https://frappe.io/framework)

Frappe delivers an application framework with interesting business applications. The ease of installation of a complex application stack is inspirational.

Frappe applications can be deployed in TAPPaaS and become optional modules. We see Frappe as complementary rather than competing.

### Dokku

[dokku.com](https://dokku.com/)

Similar in goals to Frappe. We see Dokku as a potential module in TAPPaaS.

### Qubes OS

[qubes-os.org](https://www.qubes-os.org/)

Great security model. TAPPaaS implements something similar, working toward a zero-trust model. Qubes OS is aimed at the desktop and can be a worthy alternative to macOS or Windows if you care about security.

### HexOS

[hexos.com](https://hexos.com/)

There seem to be interesting core ideas in HexOS that overlap with TAPPaaS. HexOS is still in closed beta, so it's hard to tell exactly what it will deliver and how much will be open source.
